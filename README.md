# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose

Beks is a data scientist and programmer for Alphabet Soup, a philanthropic organization that has funded multiple groups in the last 20 years focusing on humanitarian efforts. She has been asked to predict which organizations are too high-risk to donate for dontations and which ones are good candidates.  From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.  We will be helping Beks use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


## Summary:
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
